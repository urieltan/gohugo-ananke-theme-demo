#### Introduction

{{< figure src="/uploads/2018/05/03/900px-KB_United_S_" titl_" >}}

Not many people know about this keyboard layout called the Simplified Dvorak layout. It was developed by Dr Dvorak and subsequently patented in 1936. Dvorak claims the layout to have lesser finger motion and reduces mistakes as compared to the Qwerty layout. However, this is not widely adopted perhaps because of the ratchet effect, where people had already adopted the Qwerty layout and are not willing to change as this takes retraining and even changing out typewriters.

#### Why use Dvorak? I can already touch-type on qwerty.

I’m not the best guy to look for explaining the Dvorak layout, but I’ll still try my best.

It reduces the amount that your fingers need to travel by putting the most important keys on the home row and the second most important keys on the top row. Thus, with less movement, the amount of time you finger needs to take to reach the key is reduced. I mean, just look at the Qwerty keyboard, why is there a semicolon under you right pinky??.

You make less mistakes, because I don’t know why.

Your fingers have less stress and injuries due to the much more comfortable layout (can confirm this myself with my own experiences).

By using the Dvorak layout, you feel like you are part of some elite master race that is untouchable by normies who use some Qwerty keyboard layout simply because it is the default.

#### But wait!

The Dvorak layout might not be for you if:

You type 100 words per minute in Qwerty and think you have no more improvement by changing the layout.

You are used to Vim shortcuts or any other keyboard shortcuts for that matter and changing the keyboard layout will totally mess up your work flow.

You only type on mobile phones and never on a computer.

You don’t want to be ‘that guy’ over there who lives on the fringes of society and do crazy and weird stuff.

It is impossible to change the layout in your computer system for some reason.

You are left handed and feel that more than 60% of the typing is done by your non-dominant hand.

#### My own experience

I was still halfway between touch typing and pecking the keyboard before someone mentioned something about a Dvorak keyboard to me. Being the naturally curious person I am, I went to find out more about this and eventually switching over to this layout and learning on it. It was really a much more efficient layout than Qwerty (I went back to learn Qwerty for fun and found out that it is really awful). Also my speed on Dvorak is around 78-80 wpm on typingtest.com.

#### Conclusion

So overall I really recommend investing the time to learn Dvorak if you have it. Otherwise, typing on the Qwerty keyboard won’t kill you.
